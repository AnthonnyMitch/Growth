Growth: An interative application in which a user can log in to their personal profile, search plants using their common or scientific name, and get data returned from the trefle plants API and the USDA Complete PLANTS Checklist Database such as:
- Scientific name, 
- Family 
- Common name
- Species
- Sub species
- Climate preference
- Growing instructions
- The plant's image
- links to similar plants.

There will also be an option for the user to save plants to their profile and retrieve them at a later date.

We are also aiming to use a map API to show locations nearby the user where they are able to purchase plants.
